(iii) Cleaning data

by applying the steps define, code, and test

(iv)Save the master dataset at the end of cleaning process

(v)Analyze the data to give insights

The master dataset is analyzed using pandas or SQL in the Jupyter Notebook and at least three (3) separate insights are produced and create atleast one (1) labeled visualization is produced in the Jupyter Notebook using Pythonâ€™s plotting libraries or in Tableau.
